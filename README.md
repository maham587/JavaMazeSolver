# Java Maze Project

This is a Java program that generates and solves mazes using various algorithms. It includes a graphical user interface for displaying the mazes and the solving process.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Once you have Java installed, you can download or clone this repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE. You can then run the `MainView.java` file to launch the program inside `uiMVC package`

## Features

The program includes the following features:

- Maze generation algorithms:
  - package maze
  
- Maze solving algorithms:
  - package dijkstra : Dijkstra's algorithm
 

## Usage

When you launch the program, you'll be presented with a window where you can create a new maze by sizing it. You will be also able to save it and open it if you need.
You don't need to click `Solve Button`, the maze is solved dynamically. Once a path exits, the program will display the solving process graphically, showing the path being explored by the solving algorithm.
